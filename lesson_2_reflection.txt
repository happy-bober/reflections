# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates a directory containing metadat files which it uses to track the file history
without this, git doesn't know that I want it to watch the files in this repository
# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area which allows me to select which files from the working directory I want to commit to the repository. This allows me to split my chnages into multiple commits 
or hold off on committing files which haven't been finalised in order to preseve the 'one commit per logical change' paradigm

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can only commit changes to the files which included the 1 logical change instead of commiting all files

# What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When creating separate version of the program, e.g. language versions 
or experimenting with adding extra features
or for multiple people working on features concurrently
by allowing chains of changes to the code to happen to different version of the code

# How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams make it clear which commits are reachable from which branch. 
They make it clear which version of the production code each development branch is based on
