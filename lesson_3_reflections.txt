# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate with others
to make your code public
to be able to work on your code from different machines
as a backup

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
code might not be ready to publish
might not want to pull changes from other contributors

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is a clone between github repositories
clone copies repositories locally or from github to a local machine
a branch is a label for a series of commits in a repository, regardless of whether it's local or remote.
I'd use a branch to work on a feature or version of the master code, but with the possibility of updating the master code as well as the feature
i'd use a fork to work independently on a project started by someone else
