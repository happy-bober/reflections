# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate with others
to make your code public
to be able to work on your code from different machines
as a backup

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
code might not be ready to publish
might not want to pull changes from other contributors
